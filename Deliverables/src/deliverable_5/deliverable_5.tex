course.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Part 1}
\subsection{System Summary}
CinemaScout is a movie search tool which aims to provide a faster and more
accurate method of receiving movie suggestions. This is achieved 
through the rectification of a number of harmful design choices made by other 
movie suggestion platforms, most often in place as an unintended consequence 
of centralisation. These include:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Restricted Movie Database}: Only movies which are available for
viewing on the same platform are recommended, restricting the scope of movies
available.
\item \textbf{History Poisoning}: Movie recommendations are based on previous
browsing history or via similar metadata, producing unwanted and erroneous
movie suggestions due to the indeterminant browsing habits of most users.
\item \textbf{Low Computational Requirement}: Movie recommendation is often a
smaller, neglected module of a larger platform, elliciting a low computational 
requirement and therefore poor quality results.
\item \textbf{Corporate Bias}: Private business deals between platforms force
suggestions to benefit its business partners, degrading the quality and
integrity of results.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Feature List}
Principally, CinemaScout provides the ability for a user to traverse the entire
IMDb database via a procedurally generated questionaire. The questionaire 
enables a user to identify an extremely specific and unique subset of high
quality movies. In addition, CinemaScout provides the following auxillary 
features:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Automatic Exclusion}: The ability for a search to preemptively 
remove movies based on commonly disliked criteria.
\item \textbf{Search Progress Bar}: A progress bar which represents the amount
of movies which have been filtered by the questionaire so far.
\item \textbf{Current Best Result}: A repeatedly updating hint describing a
movie which the questionaire references.
\item \textbf{Additional Information}: Additional information for each
movie such as year, runtime, plot, director and many more.
\item \textbf{Movie Posters}: The official poster image for each movie as a 
visual guide for easy identification.
\item \textbf{Results Table}: A condensed, tabulated form of the results.
Movies can be sorted by name, year, rating, popularity and runtime.
\item \textbf{Print Results}: The ability to print the results in an easy to
read format.
\item \textbf{Save Results}: The ability to save results, which remain 
persistent between browser, computer and server restarts.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{User Stories}
The following user stories have been corrected, primarily to accomodate for the
`View Saved Search' button and the lack of a feasbile way to present
trailers of movies due to YouTube API restrictions. The user stories now
correctly reflect the final stage of the design.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{User Story}: As an avid film watcher, I want to receive
tailored, specific recommendations relevant to me.
\newline \textbf {Scenario:} Given that I am on the website and that I perform
a movie search, when I receive results, then I should see results which are
most relevant to me.

\item \textbf{User Story}: As someone who enjoys multiple movie genres, I want
to receive recommendations which are not based on my previous viewing sessions.
\newline \textbf {Scenario:} Given that I am on the website and I have
previously made a search and I perform a new search, when I receive results,
then the results should not be an amalgamation of my previous sessions.

\item \textbf{User Story}: As a power user, I wish to be able to receive many
movie recommendations over a short period of time.
\newline \textbf {Scenario:} Given that I have performed many searches recently,
and I want to perform a new search, when I receive results, then the new
results are not rate limited.

\item \textbf{User Story}: As a first time website visitor, I wish to be able
to perform a search without offering my credentials and other personal
information to first generate an account.
\newline \textbf {Scenario:} Given that I have visited the website, and I want
to make my first search, when I attempt to search, then I am not prompted
to first create an account.

\item \textbf{User Story}: As a user of the service, I wish to be able to use
the service in its full capability without malicious content from ever
corrupting my movie suggestions.
\newline \textbf {Scenario:}  Given that I have visited the website, and I make
my search, when I receive my results, then the results should be free from user
generated content.

\item \textbf{User Story}: As a user of the service, I do not wish to receive
recommendations based on corporate interests or monetary influence.
\newline \textbf {Scenario:} Given that I have visited the website, and I make
my search, when I receive my results, then the results should be free from
corporate bias.

\item \textbf{User Story}: As a returning user of the service, I wish to be able
to view my recommendations and come back to my search results later.
\newline \textbf {Scenario:} Given that I am on the website, and I have
previously made and saved a search, then I can return back to the result page 
and view my former results by clicking `View Saved Seach'.

\item \textbf{User Story}: As a user of CinemaScout who wants to print out my
results, I wish to be able to print out a formatted version of the results page
tailored for readability on an A4 page.
\newline \textbf {Scenario:} Given that I am on the result page, and I click
`Print Results', then a prompt to print my results will be opened.

\item \textbf{User Story}: As a user of CinemaScout who wishes to view
the results of the search offline, I want to be able to download the search
results in a readable format for offline use.
\newline \textbf {Scenario:} Given that I am on the result page, and I click
`Print Results', then a PDF copy of the current page may be copied via the
browser.

All images were captured at a resolution of 1920 x 1080 using a default
Chromium browser on Arch Linux. This implementation of CinemaScout was captured
at cinemascout.xyz.
