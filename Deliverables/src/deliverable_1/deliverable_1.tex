\section*{Introduction}
The purpose of this report is to identify and express high level requirements
regarding a potential software system via structured notation. We will express
the contents of our report in the following format.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Problem Statements}: A series of problem statements which will
investigate a number of problems we will solve via our software prototype.
\item \textbf{User Stories}: An idenfitication of features based on the problem
statement previously specified.
\item \textbf{Low-Fidelity Prototype}: A paper physical sketch of the UI 
elements integrated with a storyboard-like chronological script.
\item \textbf{High-Fidelity Prototype}: A computerised render of the
low-fidelity prototype previously specified.
\end{enumerate}
